    title: "Classic Zinger Burger",
    recipe:
      "To make the Classic Zinger Burger, start by flattening the chicken breasts to an even thickness. Marinate them in a mixture of buttermilk, salt, black pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, and cayenne pepper (if using) for at least 1 hour or overnight for best results. In a separate bowl, prepare the coating by combining all-purpose flour, cornflour, baking powder, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, black pepper, salt, and cayenne pepper. Remove the marinated chicken from the buttermilk mixture, dredge it thoroughly in the flour mixture, pressing it on to ensure a good coating. For extra crunch, double-dip by returning the chicken to the buttermilk and then back to the flour mixture. Heat vegetable oil to 350°F (175°C) in a large skillet or deep fryer, ensuring there's enough oil to submerge the chicken. Fry the coated chicken breasts for 6-8 minutes until golden brown and cooked through, then drain on paper towels. Toast the burger buns if desired, spread mayo on the bottom bun and ketchup on the top bun, and assemble the burger with the crispy chicken patty, lettuce, tomato slices, onion slices, and a slice of cheese. Top with the other half of the bun and serve hot with your favorite side dishes. Enjoy your crispy, flavorful Zinger Burger!",
